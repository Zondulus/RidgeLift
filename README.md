RidgeLift adds a simulation of the real-world phenomenon of ridge lift and mountain waves to Kerbal Space Program. Moving wind currents which hit a mountain or steep cliff are forced upward, creating a rising air mass which can lift a glider. Sinking air currents are also created downwind of large mountain cliffs, making navigation of steep mountain terrain even more hazardous. Careful piloting and strong wind can cause a glider to climb kilometers.
